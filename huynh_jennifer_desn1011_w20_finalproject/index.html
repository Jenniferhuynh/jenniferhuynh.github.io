                            She seems to be on the phone,speaking into her car's system.
                            Fast, fiery, full of energy --

                            It was pure insanity.
                            Mia stops. Thinks. Mutters to herself: "Insanity"... Then
                            leans down and grabs a piece of paper from the passenger
                            seat. It's a SCRIPT.

                            He begins a new chart: "Deck the Halls". But something seems
                            to come over him now. He's restless. Slowly, his playing
                            drifts off -- his fingers charting their own path...
                            <br><br>
                            And then -- we hear a melody. The one Mia heard outside. 
                            <br>The one we'll refer to from now on as Mia and Sebastian's song...
                            <br><br>
                            The door opens -- and Mia steps in. She sees Sebastian at the piano.
                            Is instantly struck by his playing.

                            Mia and Sebastian try to downplay the romanticism of this
                            setting, this moment -- being lost here, at night, alone
                            together, atop a hill, the city glittering before them. Itâ€™s "no big deal",
                            nothing they haven't seen or felt before --
                            because, after all, there's no chance for romance between them...

                            Of course, the music, swelling and building, suggests
                            otherwise. And -- bit by bit -- before our eyes -- they've almost slipped into DANCE...

                            CATS here -- except for Mia and Sebastian, watching a QUARTET...

                            Most people say they hate jazz because
                            they don't have context. They don't get
                            where it came from. All these people
                            packed into flophouses in New Orleans,
                            speaking five different languages, and
                            jazz was how they talked to each other.
                            That's why you need to be in the space
                            and see what's at stake. This whole thing
                            -- it's dying. But when I have my own place -- my club --
                            they'll play whatever they want.

                            Mia looks at Sebastian. Her laughter has subsided. She can
                            see something in him now -- the same passion he's speaking of...

                            old-Hollywood big-musical fashion --

                            It's their first kiss, and it's a kiss to remember -- full of
                            all the hope and yearning and terror and wonder of love's first
                            blush. A swoon-worthy kiss, with the orchestra soaring and the
                            camera swooping in to catch the embrace in all its glory.

                            Beat. Sebastian looks up at the Observatory.<br><br>
                                
                            <b>SEBASTIAN (CONT'D)</b><br>

                            Mia heads over, curious. The music grows louder -- sounds like
                            a JAZZ COMBO. Mia peeks toward the door...<br><br>

                            The sign on the door reads: "SEB'S". It's written the way she
                            drew it for Sebastian, years ago...<br><br>
                            
                            Coming up to her side, oblivious --<br><br>

                            David edges past Mia. Glimpses the bar inside. Turns to her,
                            inviting --<br><br>

                            Mia doesn't know what to say. She follows David...

                            The crowd laughs. Sebastian smiles, looks at them --<br><br>
    
                            -- and sees Mia.<br><br>
                            
                            Shock. The two LOCK EYES -- and you can tell it's the first
                            time they've seen each other in years.<br><br>
                            
                            A prolonged silence. Sebastian is speechless.<br><br>
                            
                            Then -- forcing himself to keep on a face --<br><br>

                            More applause. Sebastian sits at the piano. Looks at the keys.<br><br>
                            
                            He seems uncertain -- perhaps unsure what to play. He looks at
                            Mia. Takes the sight in. Beat. Then looks at his fellow
                            musicians. Murmurs to them. Then turns back to the keys --<br><br>
                            
                            -- and finally starts playing.<br><br>
                            
                            A quieter tune, just piano, soft and tender and melancholy. A
                            melody we -- and Mia -- instantly recognize...<br><br>
                            
                            It's Mia and Sebastian's song.

                            Just as they reach the door, and as David steps out, Mia turns
                            and looks back at Sebastian. He looks at her. Their eyes lock.
                            A hint of a tear in both...<br><br>
    
                            And, ever so subtly, for just a fleeting second, Mia smiles.<br><br>
    
                            It's the kind of smile you could miss if you blinked -- but
                            it's enough to signal to Sebastian that she recognized the
                            melody he played, and that she still remembers it, and still
                            thinks of it to this day...<br><br>
    
                            Then she walks out the door.<br><br>
    
                            END.
